### Milestone #2: Understand ''similarity'' for NLP

Start date: Jul 26, 2018

End date: Aug 9, 2018

Status: In Progress

Lead: Yunshu Du

Advisor: Nidhi Hegde

### Goal:
Understand how different ''similarity'' measurements are connected

Understand if ''transferability'' is connected with similarity

### Outcomes:
TBA

### Previous:
Milestone #1

### Next:
N/A

### Steps:
**Start with existing repo on NLP similarity**:

  - <https://github.com/brightmart/nlu_sim>  
  
  - Python Notebook code on some baseline similarity methods: <https://github.com/nlptown/nlp-notebooks/blob/master/Simple%20Sentence%20Similarity.ipynb>
  
  - The paper related to the notebook: <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.06259.pdf>
      
**Things to consider**:
        
  - Map word embedding (feature) similarity to raw text (semantic) similarity

  - Tree distance in WordNet as similarity measure <https://wordnet.princeton.edu/>

  - Domain adaptation (mostly in image domain): 
  
      - in image, directly looking at pixel similarity is not meaningful; However, in text, word similarity is connected and meaningful for similarity.
